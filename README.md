# Huffman Compression Project - Full Stack Guide

This project combines a C backend for Huffman compression with a Node.js server and a React frontend.

## Project Structure

Your project folder should look like this:

```
/
|-- src/                  # Your C source files (huffman.c, heap.c, etc.)
|-- components/           # React components (FileUploader.tsx)
|-- uploads/              # Created automatically by the server for temp files
|
|-- App.tsx               # Main React component
|-- index.html            # Main HTML file
|-- index.tsx             # React entry point
|-- metadata.json
|
|-- Makefile              # Your makefile to compile the C code
|-- huffman               # The COMPILED C binary (on Linux/macOS)
|-- huffman.exe           # The COMPILED C binary (on Windows)
|
|-- package.json          # Node.js project file (NEW)
|-- server.js             # The Node.js server (NEW)
|-- README.md             # This file (NEW)
```

## How to Run Everything (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Compile Your C Code

First, you need to compile your C program into a single executable file. Use the `Makefile` you provided.

Open your terminal in the project's root directory and run:

```bash
make
```

This command should create an executable file named `huffman` (on Linux/macOS) or `huffman.exe` (on Windows). **This file must be in the same root directory as `server.js`**.

### Step 2: Set Up and Run the Node.js Backend

The Node.js server acts as a bridge between the web interface and your C program.

1.  **Install Node.js**: If you don't have it, download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2.  **Install Dependencies**: In the terminal, run this command to install Express, Multer, and CORS.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the Server**: Now, run the server.

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

You should see a message: `✅ Server is running on http://localhost:8080`. The backend is now ready.

### Step 3: Run the Frontend

The frontend is served by the development environment you are using. Just make sure it's running.

Now, open your web application in the browser. You should be able to upload a `.txt` file, click "Compress & Download File", and receive the compressed `.huff` file generated by your C code!
